# pi-gen-docker
Modifications to the RPI pi-gen tool ( https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen ) to create a ready to go raspberry pi docker server

Getting docker to run on a pi is not *that* complex but it would be nice if you could just have it stood up and ready to go. 

The image created at the end of this also has docker-compose on it.
